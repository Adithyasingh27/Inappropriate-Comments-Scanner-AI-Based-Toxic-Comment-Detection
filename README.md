# ⚠️ Inappropriate Comments Scanner  
### AI-Based Toxic Comment Detection System

This project identifies **toxic and inappropriate comments** using an AI-powered text classification model built with **Bidirectional LSTM** and **TensorFlow**. It improves upon traditional keyword-based filtering by understanding **context**, **intent**, and **language patterns**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
Traditional moderation approaches struggle with:
- High manual effort  
- Static keyword rules  
- Poor detection of slang, sarcasm, and context  

This project solves these issues by using a **deep-learning NLP pipeline** capable of real-time classification across multiple toxicity categories.

---

## 🚀 Features
✔️ Multi-label toxicity detection  
✔️ Bidirectional LSTM model for contextual understanding  
✔️ End-to-end preprocessing pipeline using `TextVectorization`  
✔️ Real-time inference using **Gradio** UI  
✔️ Train/Val/Test pipeline using TF Datasets (cache, shuffle, batch, prefetch)  
✔️ Exportable `.keras` model  
✔️ Scalable design for cloud deployment (AWS/GCP)
